            allow_substring_file_names (bool, optional): Allow substrings during sample identification by adding
                image or label grep to the sample prefixes. If False, treats sample prefixes as full file names.
                If True and no split file is provided, considers the file stem as prefix, otherwise the full file name.
                Defaults to True.
            class_names (list[str], optional): Names of the classes. Defaults to None.

                modalities. Should end with ToTensorV2() and not include normalization. The transform is not applied to 
                non-image data, which is only converted to tensors if possible. If dict, can include separate transforms 
                per modality (no shared parameters between modalities). 
                Defaults to None, which simply applies ToTensorV2().
            val_transform (Albumentations.Compose | dict | None): Albumentations transform to be applied to all image
                modalities. Should end with ToTensorV2() and not include normalization. The transform is not applied to 
                non-image data, which is only converted to tensors if possible. If dict, can include separate transforms

                per modality (no shared parameters between modalities). 
                Defaults to None, which simply applies ToTensorV2().
            shared_transforms (bool): transforms are shared between all image modalities (e.g., similar crop). 
                This setting is ignored if transforms are defined per modality. Defaults to True.  
            expand_temporal_dimension (bool): Go from shape (time*channels, h, w) to (channels, time, h, w).
                Only works with image modalities. Is only applied to modalities with defined dataset_bands.
                Defaults to False.
            no_data_replace (float | None): Replace nan values in input images with this value. If none, does no 
                replacement. Defaults to None.
            no_label_replace (int | None): Replace nan values in label with this value. If none, does no replacement. 
                Defaults to None.

            num_workers (int): Number of parallel workers. Defaults to 0 for single threaded process.

            data_with_sample_dim (bool): Use a specific collate function to concatenate samples along a existing sample
                dimension instead of stacking the samples. Defaults to False.
            sample_num_modalities (int, optional): Load only a subset of modalities per batch. Defaults to None.
            sample_replace (bool): If sample_num_modalities is set, sample modalities with replacement.
                Defaults to False.
            channel_position (int): Position of the channel dimension in the image modalities. Defaults to -3.
            concat_bands (bool): Concatenate all image modalities along the band dimension into a single "image", so
                that it can be processed by single-modal models. Concatenate in the order of provided modalities.
                Works with image modalities only. Does not work with allow_missing_modalities. Defaults to False.
