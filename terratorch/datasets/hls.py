    The `Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS)
     <https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`_ project is a NASA initiative
    aiming to produce a seamless surface reflectance record from the
    Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard
    Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2A/B remote sensing satellites, respectively.
    The HLS products are hosted at `LP DAAC
    <https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/hls-data/>`_, and created from a set of
    algorithms: atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking,
    geographic co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance
    distribution function (BRDF) normalization, and bandpass adjustment. The
    HLS Version-2.0 data are available now with global coverage (except for
    Antarctica). With four sensors currently in this virtual constellation,
    HLS provides observations once every three days at the equator and more
    frequently with increasing latitude. The HLS project is a collaboration
    between NASA and USGS, with the science team at NASA Goddard Space Flight
    Center supported by USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS)
    Center on atmospheric correction, the production team at NASA Marshall
    Space Flight Center, and product archive at USGS.
