        Further arguments to be passed to the backbone, decoder or head. They should be prefixed with
        `backbone_`, `decoder_` and `head_` respectively.

        Args:
            task (str): Task to be performed. Currently supports "segmentation" and "regression".
            backbone (str, nn.Module): Backbone to be used. If string, should be able to be parsed
                by the specified factory. Defaults to "prithvi_100".
            decoder (Union[str, nn.Module], optional): Decoder to be used for the segmentation model.
                    If a string, it will be created from a class exposed in decoder.__init__.py with the same name.
                    If an nn.Module, we expect it to expose a property `decoder.out_channels`.
                    Will be concatenated with a Conv2d for the final convolution. Defaults to "FCNDecoder".
            in_channels (int, optional): Number of input channels. Defaults to 3.
            bands (list[terratorch.datasets.HLSBands], optional): Bands the model will be trained on.
                    Should be a list of terratorch.datasets.HLSBands.
                    Defaults to [HLSBands.RED, HLSBands.GREEN, HLSBands.BLUE].
            num_classes (int, optional): Number of classes. None for regression tasks.
            pretrained (Union[bool, Path], optional): Whether to load pretrained weights for the backbone, if available.
                Defaults to True.
            num_frames (int, optional): Number of timesteps for the model to handle. Defaults to 1.
            prepare_features_for_image_model (Callable | None): Function to be called on encoder features
                before passing them to the decoder. Defaults to None, which applies the identity function.
            aux_decoders (list[AuxiliaryHead] | None): List of AuxiliaryHead deciders to be added to the model.
                These decoders take the input from the encoder as well.
            rescale (bool): Whether to apply bilinear interpolation to rescale the model output if its size
                is different from the ground truth. Only applicable to pixel wise models
                (e.g. segmentation, pixel wise regression). Defaults to True.
