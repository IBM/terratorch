# Contribution Process

If you want to contribute to this project, there are many valuable ways in doing so

1. Join the weekly community calls as indicated in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
1. Use / test TerraTorch and create an [Issue](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/issues) if something is not working properly or if you have an idea for a feature request.
1. Pick an [Issue](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/issues) and start contributing

Contributions are welcome as pull requests on a [fork](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/fork) of this project. Ideally, pull requests are backed by an [Issue](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/issues). You can also tag the [code owners](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) in the issue before you start, so we can talk about the details (in case you can't join one of the community calls).

After or during implementation on your branch, please create a PR to main. During development, please mark this PR as DRAFT and prefix with '[WIP]'
If you want us to merge the PR, remove 'draft' and '[WIP]'. Before that, please make sure that all tests are passing. Unit tests are automatically run on GitHub on the branch as well. The TerraTorch committers will review your code and will run integrations tests on our GPU cluster before we merge to main.
